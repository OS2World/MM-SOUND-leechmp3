Leechmp3: changes in version 3.40, 2001-05-19

New: Leechmp3 can now reimport MP3 CDs that have been saved
using the "SAVE MY RECORDS TO CD" program.
This only work with CDs created with LEECHMP3 3.40.
The imported CD will be merged with you current MY RECORDS folder and
playlists will be updated.

- Sound files have been replaced by files in mp3 format,
which means that you need to have Z! installed
if you want to hear spoken progress messages.
This makes a smaller package.
note: if Z! not installed, you'll hear nothing but LEECHMP3
will work anyway.

- ZPLAY.EXE improved; Starting to play a new
track stops the one previously playing.
Double clicking on the currently playing track stops it.

- Extension for the playlist files has been changed
from .mpl to .M3U to be more standard (especially
to comply with the extensions accepted by my TERRATEC M3PO machine).


Leechmp3: changes in version 3.30, 2001-05-08

- Titles of windows now update so you can know
what the programs are doing simply looking at the
window list.

-Added a new program called "VIEW CD TRACKLIST"
that simply connects to cddb and display content of the cd.

- Cleaned up code of most of the programs.


Leechmp3: changes in version 3.20, 2001-05-04

- The installation program now does not perform
any undesired object deletion!

- Improved behaviour of the COPY2CD program
(Save My records to CD using CDRECORD/2).
It now accepts MKISOFS2 and CDRECORD2 coming from
the CDRTOOLS package found on hobbes.

- Now, each folder is sorted according to the order
the tracks were in the original CD.


Leechmp3: changes in version 3.10, 2001-04-27

- The install program now detects if a previous "MY RECORDS" directory
exists and, if yes, reuses it.

- Fixed a bug in wave files deletion when using LEECH.

- Improved detection and use of Tonigy (Thanks to rexx
samples supplied by Tonigy developpment team). This
might work only with Tonigy 1.10.

- Added some more CDDB servers in the configuration file.

- Included a 3.89 beta Lame version
that gives much better results at high byte rates
