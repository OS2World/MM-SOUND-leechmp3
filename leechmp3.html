<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

<B>LEECHMP3</B>

is a set of REXX programs that automates
the process of converting audio CDs to MP3 files and store them in folders.
There are 3 folders levels:
<OL>
<LI>Category (folk, rock, blues, classical...)
<LI>Artist (artist name)
<LI>Record (all the record's tracks)
</OL>
The folder are built according to the info found in the <B>CDDB</B> database to
which the program connects when starting the process.<BR>
In the record folder, each track is identified by its full name, using OS/2
extended attributes to mask the real name of the MP3 file.<BR>
At each folder level, a playlist is built allowing you to hear all the tracks
that are in thsi folder and its subfolders.<BR>

<P>A utility programs allows you to save all your folders on a CD, which can
be usefull if you have a portable cd player supporting MP3 format, or such a
player in your car for example.<HR>


<P><A NAME="need">&nbsp;</a>
<H2>What do I need?</H2>

<B>LEECHMP3</B>
needs several additional components that are all freeware:
<OL>
<LI> You need at least a HPFS formated unit where to store the CD database.

<LI>A CD grabber to read the cd and convert it into WAVE format:<P> I use <B>LEECH</B>
cause of its excellent dijittering capabilities and of its ease of use. You can
<A HREF="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/apps/mmedia/cd/grabber/leech120.zip">download it here</a>

<LI>A MP3 encoder to convert WAV files into MP3 format:<P> I use <B>LAME</B> which
probably is the best one and runs under OS/2. A version of <B>LAME</B> is
provided in the package, but you'll need to
<A HREF="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/dev/emx/v0.9d/emxrt.zip">download EMXRT</A>
to have it running. After installing <B>EMXRT</B>, you must install
<A HREF="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/dev/emx/v0.9d/emxfix03.zip">EMXFIX03</A>
to have <B>EMX runtime</B> aht the most appropriate level.

<LI>A <B>CDDB</B> client program to connect to a
<B>CDDB</B> server and retrieve the CD information:<P>
The <B>QUERYCDDB</B> program is included in the package, but comes from a very
nice <B>Chris Wohlgemuths</B> package called
<B>AUDIO-CD-CREATOR</B> that you can download from
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Sector/5785/#es.com/SiliconValley/Sector/5785/#cdrecord"> Chris Wohlgemuths Home Page</A<<BR>
On his page, you will also find the source code of this nice package and older versions of <B>CDRECORD/2</B>.

<LI>A MP3 player:<P>
You should use <B>Z!</B> from
<A HREF="http://www.dink.org">DINK HOMEPAGE</A>
because the <B>ZPLAY</B> program coming with <B>LEECHMP3</B> uses it to play
either MP3 files or playlists.

<LI>If you want to transfer your songs database on a CD, you will
also need to install <B>CDRECORD/2</B>. You can find newest version on
<A HREF="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu"> HOBBES</A<<BR>
<B>CDRECORD/2</B> is not so easy to install, so carefully follow instructions.<BR>
if <B>CDRECORD/2</B> is not installed, the corresponding entry
in the <B>LEECHMP3</B> folder will not be installed.

</OL><HR>


<P><A NAME="install">&nbsp;</a>
<H2>INSTALLATION</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Unzip <B>LEECHMP3.ZIP</B> in a temporary directory (if you read
this, it should already be done).

<LI> <A HREF="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/apps/mmedia/cd/grabber/leech120.zip">Download</a>
and unzip <B>LEECH</B> in the same tempo directory.

<LI>Run the <B>INSTALL</B> program.<BR>
It will ask you directories where to put programs and database.<BR>
For the CD database, the program automatically
determines the HPFS unit where you have
the more free space, you may choose another one.<BR>
if you have the <B>Z!</B> MP3 player installed,
the program will ask you if you want to associate it to MPL and
.MP3 files thru the <B>ZPLAY</B> program that comes with <B>LEECHMP3</B>.
This program determines if the input file is a .MP3 file or a playlist
(.MPL file) and passes it to <B>Z!</B> with the appropriate parameters.<BR>
Note that <B>Z!</B> must be installed in a directory
figuring in the path variable of your config.sys file.<BR>

<LI>All needed objects should now be created, you only
have to open the <B>LEECHMP3</B> folder and play.
</ol><HR>

<P><A NAME="loadnew">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Load a new record</H2>

This is the main <B>LEECHMP3</B> program. It will do the following:<P>

Read the <B>CDID</B> from the cd and pass it to
the CDDB client to retrieve category, artist name and track titles
from a CDDB server.<BR>
The CDID is an identificator that should be unique
for each audio CD, it is  the key for CDDB.
But the CDDB may be incomplete or contain errors, or you may
not be connected to internet.<BR>
If the CDID provided matches several entries in the CDDB, the <B>QUERYCDDB</B>
program will ask to choose one of them.<BR>
If nothing is retrieved from CDDB for any reason, <B>LEECHMP3</B>
will ask you if you want to continue loading the CD.
If the answer is yes, the CD will be placed in the 'UNTITLED' category
and the tracks will have no title, but a track number, not very nice!<BR>
If info is correctly retrived, appropriate folders are created
and the CD is loaded and converted to MP3.<BR>
After all this, the playlists are built so that you can hear all your CD
at once.<HR>

<P><A NAME="myrec">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>My records</H2>

This is the entry folder where all your record folders are created.<BR>
Opening it, you will find one folder for each music category.<BR>
In each category, you will find folders for the artists
and for each artist, the records you have already loaded.<BR>
After installation, the <B>MY RECORDS</B> folder is empty.<HR>

<P><A NAME="rebuild">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Rebuild playlists<H2>

After you have loaded some records, you may want
to delete one. You may also find that the category
in which CDDB placed the artist and record
is not the one where you would have placed it! (CDDB
sometimes has strange choices).<BR>
So you can delete a record, an artist, or move a folder to another place.<BR>
After this, the already created playliists may point to songs
that don't exist anymore or that have been moved.<BR>
Simply double click on the <B>REBUILD PLAYLISTS</B>
program and the playlists will again be acurate.<HR>

<P><A NAME="save">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Save My records to CD using CDRECORD/2</H2>

This function will appear in the <B>LEECHMP3</B> folder
only if <B>CDRECORD/2</B> was installed at the moment
when you installed <B>LEECHMP3</B>. Note that <B>CDRECORD.EXE</B> and <B>MKISOFS.EXE</B>, part of the <B>CDRECORD/2</b>
package must be located in a directory figuring in the path variable
of your config.sys file.<BR>
This program will save all the database on a CD. The database must
not be bigger that the space available on the CD (about 682 MB).<BR>
On the CD, the tracks' long names won't be preserved, so you will see them
with there physical filename.<HR>

<p><A NAME="edit">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EDIT LEECHMP3 CONFIGURATION FILE</H2>


This program allows you to edit the <B>LEECHMP3 CONFIGURATION FILE</B>
using the system editor.<BR>
This file allows you to configure the following parameters:
<UL>

<LI>CDROM letter: The address of your cdrom unit. If not defined, the
programs try to determine it automatically but it might sometimes fail.<BR>

<LI>CDDB URL AND PORT: This is for the <B>QUERYCDDB</B> program.
It tells it where to connect to retrieve CDDB information. If not defined
the default is cddb.cddb.com 8880. You may choose another one.<BR>

<LI>LEECH PARAMETERS:  This allows you to tune LEECH parameters
to get the best results depending on your system and your cdrom unit.
The LEECH documentation should be installed in the <B>LEECHMP3</B> folder,
check at it for more details about those parameters.<BR>

<LI>LAME PARAMETERS: These parameters determines the way
<B>LAME</B> will encode the files(byte rate, quality...).
A short LAME HELP is available in the <B>LEECHMP3</B> folder,
check at it for those parameters. If not defined, <B>LAME</B> uses its default parameters.<BR>

<LI>CD RECORDER SCSI ID: This is for <B>CDRECORD/2</B>.
To retrieve this info, enter the following command in an OS/2 window:<BR>
cdrecord -scanbus<BR>
and find it in the displayed result.<BR>
If not defined, <B>CDRECORD/2</B> won't work.<BR>

<LI>CD WRITER MAX SPEED: This parameter is also for
<B>CDRECORD/2</B>. Check it in your writer documentation.
</UL><HR>


<p><A NAME="tonigy">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>USING TONIGY TO GRAB TRACKS</H2>

     Using <B>TONIGY</B> to grab tracks is
an interesting alternative to <B>LEECH</B>.<BR>
Tonigy is a shareware IFS that shows the audio CD as a collection of
tracks in Wave or Raw format. So, tracks don't need to be first saved on
the hard disk, then can be directly encoded from the CD, which saves
space and time.<BR>
You can download Tonigy from
<A HREF="http://tonigy.hypermart.net">here</A>. <BR>
<B>LEECHMP3</B> will first test if a Tonigy drive is attached. If not, it will
use <B>LEECH</B>.
So, to use <B>Tonigy</B> to grab, you must first start it and attach a
drive.<BR>
